# semantic-segmentation-using-CNN
During this project, I developed a neural network and optimized it to perform semantic segmentation using fully convolutional network model. 
Used torch library and tools, numpy for matrix operations, pandas for data processing and matplotlib and Python Imaging Library(PIL) for visualisation.
I used U-net architecture as the deep learning class for the training the model with images and Mask RCNN architecture for testing the model with video for object detection and segementation.
